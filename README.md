# Historic-A.Irt
Project that uses data on art to identify unknown artists of historical art

# Long Lost Artists

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

There are lots of historical and famous paintings that are seen, admired, and even inspire so many people each year. However, there are several of these paintings that stand with an unknown artist. This project will help to identify the artists of these historical art pieces.

## Background

This project will be able to identify the artists of historical paintings that don't have an artist to attribute the credit to. There are thousands of historical art pieces with an unknown author. This topic is interesting because I worked on another project that used supervised machine learning methods to identify the author of each federalist paper. This project basically decided between Alexander Hamilton and James Madison on each federalist paper according to their respective writing styles. This project made me think of some other historical applications, like art, where artificial intelligence can be a useful tool to uncover knowledge that we are unsure of or did not know.

Problem List:
* Data Collection: The data on historical artwork can be scarce, especially since a lot of museums and other art inventory centers are against the photography of the artwork. However, there is a website that offers a free download of data on over 130000 pieces of historical artwork. The data can be downloaded on GitHub, and is linked below. 
* Computational Power: My computer is starting to get kind of old, I will be running my programs on an older HP Windows computer that I got in 2019. This may limit the complexity of the AI models that I use to tackle this issue. 


## How is it used?

There are several art museums around the world that would be delighted to be informed or at least given a reasonable educated guess of who is the artist of their historical art pieces.

(will add images later)
Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">


## Data sources and AI methods
The data will come from the National Gallery of Art in Washinton, D.C. in the United States.
If you need to use links, here's an example:

## What next?

In addition, to identifying unknown artists, this project could turn into something that identifies other unique aspects of a painting such as its origin and time of creation.
